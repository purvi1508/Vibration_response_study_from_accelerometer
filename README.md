# Vibration_response_study_from_accelerometer
The free vibration test is carried out on 2DOF building in shake table. The vibration response  obtained from wireless accelerometer sensor both in x and y directions have done the time domain acceleration analysis, the frequency domain analysis and estimating the first two natural frequency of a structure
